# mqtt-softapwifiprov sample Quick Reference

This file provides a quick reference for building, flashing, and debugging the `mqtt-softapwifiprov` sample.
mqtt-softapwifiprov sample is modified from original nrf/samples/net/mqtt sample by adding softap wifi provisioning demoed by nrf/samples/wifi/provisioning/softap sample.

## Building and Running

### Basic Build Commands

For **nRF7002 DK (non-secure)**:
```zsh
west build -p -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp/ns -- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=overlay-softap-wifiprov-nrf70.conf
```

For **nRF7002 DK (secure)**:
```zsh
west build -p -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=overlay-softap-wifiprov-nrf70.conf
```

### With TLS Support

For TLS-enabled builds:
```zsh
# Non-secure with TLS
west build -p -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp/ns -- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE="overlay-softap-wifiprov-nrf70.conf;overlay-tls-nrf70.conf"

# Secure with TLS
west build -p -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE="overlay-softap-wifiprov-nrf70.conf;overlay-tls-nrf70.conf"
```

### Flashing

```zsh
west flash --erase
```

## Testing

Find the target device serial ports, normally the second one or bigger one like /dev/tty.usbmodem0010507692713 is the serial port used for log output.

```zsh
ls /dev/tty.usb*
/dev/tty.usbmodem0010507692711  
/dev/tty.usbmodem0010507692713
```

To capture device logs, run the following command. The sleep time may need to extended if not all log is captured.

```zsh
cd /opt/nordic/ncs/v3.0.2/mqtt-softapwifiprov && rm -f /opt/nordic/ncs/v3.0.2/mqtt-softapwifiprov/screenlog.0 && screen -L -S mqtt-softap-log -d -m /dev/tty.usbmodem0010507692713 115200 && nrfutil device reset --serial-number 1050769271 && sleep 10 && screen -S mqtt-softap-log -X quit && cat /opt/nordic/ncs/v3.0.2/mqtt-softapwifiprov/screenlog.0 
```

## Automated Debugging

This section describes an automated debugging process that can be used to build, flash, and debug the `mqtt-softapwifiprov` sample. The process is as follows:

1.  The firmware is built using the `west build` command, debug error if any are found.
2.  The firmware is flashed to the device using the `west flash` command.
3.  The device log is captured using the `screen` command.
4.  The device is reset using the `nrfutil device reset` command.
5.  The device log is analyzed for errors.
6.  If there are any errors, the project code is modified to fix the errors.
7.  The process is repeated until there are no errors.
